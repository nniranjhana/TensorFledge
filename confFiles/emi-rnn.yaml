# This is a sample YAML file for fault injection configuration for EMI-RNN examples
# The meaning of labels and their allowed values are explained for your choosing

# "Artifact" specifies the model parameter to inject
# 1. For emi_lstm_example.py, "Artifact" values can be:
#    - "0" - Corresponds to LSTM kernel parameters
#    - "2" - Corresponds to secondary linear classifier weights

# 2. For emi_fastgrnn_example.py, "Artifact" values can be:
#    - "0" - Corresponds to first set of W parameters of FAST GRNN cell
#    - "1" - Corresponds to second set of W parameters of FAST GRNN cell
#    - "2" - Corresponds to first set of U parameters of FAST GRNN cell
#    - "3" - Corresponds to second set of U paramters of FAST GRNN cell
#    - "8" - Corresponds to secondary linear classifier weights

Artifact: 0


# "Type" specifies the type of fault injector to call
#  - "shuffle" - Shuffles the artifact tensor values randomly
#  - "mutate"  - Single bit flips in "Bit" position to selected "Amount" of tensor values
#  - "zeros"   - Updates chosen "Amount" percentage of artifact tensor values to zeros

Type: shuffle


# "Amount" specifies the amount of injection in "Artifact"
#  - Do specify an integer value between 1 and 100
# 1. When "mutate" type is selected, "Amount" corresponds to the actual number of values
# 2. When "zeros" type is selected, "Amount" corresponds to the percentage of total values

Amount: 1


# "Bit" specifies the bit position to be flipped when "mutate" type is selected
#  - Default "N" corresponds to the position chosen randomly
#  - Can specify an integer value between 0 and 31 as "Artifact" tensor values are single precision floats

Bit: N
