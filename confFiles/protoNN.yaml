# This is a sample YAML file for fault injection configuration for the ProtoNN example
# The meaning of labels and their allowed values are explained for your choosing

# "Artifact" specifies the model parameter to inject
#  - "0" - Corresponds to W, the prototype projection matrix
#  - "1" - Corresponds to B, the prototype representation parameters
#  - "2" - Corresponds to Z, the prototype label score vectors

Artifact: 0

# "Type" specifies the type of fault injector to call
#  - "shuffle" - Shuffles the artifact tensor values randomly
#  - "mutate"  - Single bit flips in "Bit" position to selected "Amount" of tensor values
#  - "zeros"   - Updates chosen "Amount" percentage of artifact tensor values to zeros

Type: mutate


# "Amount" specifies the amount of injection in "Artifact"
#  - Do specify an integer value between 1 and 100
# 1. When "mutate" type is selected, "Amount" corresponds to the actual number of values
# 2. When "zeros" type is selected, "Amount" corresponds to the percentage of total values

Amount: 1


# "Bit" specifies the bit position to be flipped when "mutate" type is selected
#  - Default "N" corresponds to the position chosen randomly
#  - Can specify an integer value between 0 and 31 as "Artifact" tensor values are single precision floats

Bit: 30
