## Edge Machine Learning: Pytorch Library 

This package includes PyTorch implementations of following algorithms and training
techniques developed as part of EdgeML. The PyTorch graphs for the forward/backward
pass of these algorithms are packaged as `edgeml_pytorch.graph` and the trainers
for these algorithms are in `edgeml_pytorch.trainer`. 

1. [Bonsai](https://github.com/microsoft/EdgeML/blob/master/docs/publications/Bonsai.pdf): `edgeml_pytorch.graph.bonsai` implements
   the Bonsai prediction graph. The three-phase training routine for Bonsai is decoupled
   from the forward graph to facilitate a plug and play behaviour wherein Bonsai can be
   combined with or used as a final layer classifier for other architectures (RNNs, CNNs).
   See `edgeml_pytorch.trainer.bonsaiTrainer` for 3-phase training.  
2. [ProtoNN](https://github.com/microsoft/EdgeML/blob/master/docs/publications/ProtoNN.pdf): `edgeml_pytorch.graph.protoNN` implements the
   ProtoNN prediction functions. The training routine for ProtoNN is decoupled from the forward
   graph to facilitate a plug and play behaviour wherein ProtoNN can be combined with or used
   as a final layer classifier for other architectures (RNNs, CNNs). The training routine is
   implemented in `edgeml_pytorch.trainer.protoNNTrainer`.
3. [FastRNN & FastGRNN](https://github.com/microsoft/EdgeML/blob/master/docs/publications/FastGRNN.pdf): `edgeml_pytorch.graph.rnn` provides
    various RNN cells --- including new cells `FastRNNCell` and `FastGRNNCell` as well as 
    `UGRNNCell`, `GRUCell`, and `LSTMCell` --- with features like low-rank parameterisation
    of weight matrices and custom non-linearities. Akin to Bonsai and ProtoNN, the three-phase
    training routine for FastRNN and FastGRNN is decoupled from the custom cells to enable plug and
    play behaviour of the custom RNN cells in other architectures (NMT, Encoder-Decoder etc.).
    Additionally, numerically equivalent CUDA-based implementations `FastRNNCUDACell` and 
    `FastGRNNCUDACell` are provided for faster training. `edgeml_pytorch.graph.rnn`.
    `edgeml_pytorch.graph.rnn.Fast(G)RNN(CUDA)` provides unrolled RNNs equivalent to `nn.LSTM` and `nn.GRU`.
    `edgeml_pytorch.trainer.fastmodel` presents a sample multi-layer RNN + multi-class classifier model.
4. [S-RNN](https://github.com/microsoft/EdgeML/blob/master/docs/publications/SRNN.pdf): `edgeml_pytorch.graph.rnn.SRNN2` implements a 
    2 layer SRNN network which can be instantied with a choice of RNN cell. The training
    routine for SRNN is in `edgeml_pytorch.trainer.srnnTrainer`.

## Installation

It is highly recommended that EdgeML be installed in a virtual environment. 
Please create a new virtual environment using your environment manager
 ([virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/userguide/#usage) or
  [Anaconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands)).
Make sure the new environment is active before running the below mentioned commands.

Use pip to install requirements before installing the `edgeml_pytorch` library.
